## Background
Drought has been threatening people’s life and property in Australia due to the special climate and landform. Most of the area in Australia has no river and the rainfall is limited, while some other places like Melbourne are surrounded by mountains and forests, which seldom worry about the water supply. People who live in Metropolitan Melbourne seldom directly feel the threat of drought but it is really a problem which is threatening the people living in the rural area. 

Thus, drought is an inevitable topic that should be discussed with Year 5 or Year 6 students in primary schools. Currently, we can get the data or analysis of drought in Australia from many professional websites, for example, the bureau of Meteorology, the data.gov website or Kaggle. However, it is impossible for kids in schools to use those professional tools or ask them to read complicated analysis. Thus, teachers have to prepare a lot so that students can understand some complicated concepts, which aggravate the burden of teachers.

Thus, our team proposed a solution to the status quo, which is a web application. The target Audience is the students who are Year 5 or Year 6 students in primary schools, who live in metropolitan Melbourne, who don’t have a good awareness of drought and who are not an expert of data analysis. Our website would mainly focus on:
Introducing relatively completed and systematic knowledge to students, which includes the concepts of drought, the status quo, what people are doing and how to overcome drought.
Using less professional expressions and plots to give the information of drought to students.
Providing short quizzes for students to evaluate their understanding to drought. It is also a tool for teachers to evaluate the outcome of learning.
