## Background
Drought has been threatening people’s life and property in Australia due to the special climate and landform. Most of the area in Australia has no river and the rainfall is limited, while some other places like Melbourne are surrounded by mountains and forests, which seldom worry about the water supply. People who live in Metropolitan Melbourne seldom directly feel the threat of drought but it is really a problem which is threatening the people living in the rural area. 

Thus, drought is an inevitable topic that should be discussed with Year 5 or Year 6 students in primary schools. Currently, we can get the data or analysis of drought in Australia from many professional websites, for example, the bureau of Meteorology, the data.gov website or Kaggle. However, it is impossible for kids in schools to use those professional tools or ask them to read complicated analysis. Thus, teachers have to prepare a lot so that students can understand some complicated concepts, which aggravate the burden of teachers.

Thus, our team proposed a solution to the status quo, which is a web application. The target Audience is the students who are Year 5 or Year 6 students in primary schools, who live in metropolitan Melbourne, who don’t have a good awareness of drought and who are not an expert of data analysis. Our website would mainly focus on:
Introducing relatively completed and systematic knowledge to students, which includes the concepts of drought, the status quo, what people are doing and how to overcome drought.
Using less professional expressions and plots to give the information of drought to students.
Providing short quizzes for students to evaluate their understanding to drought. It is also a tool for teachers to evaluate the outcome of learning.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
